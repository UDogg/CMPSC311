# CMPSC311
#This project is a hypothetical situation when a company mounts a few disks reads data from Just A Bunch of Disks and reads it into a buffer and then unmounts the disks.
tester.c contains a few test cases for these scenarios. The given file system and disks are totally hypothetical so no integration is required.
#The SEEK and READ are enumerations defined in jbod.h please look over that file as well.
